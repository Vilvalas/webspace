            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayzhs">TwitchPlayzHS</a> (formerly <a href="https://mixer.com/mixerplayshs">MixerPlaysHS</a>) was an interactive livestream experiment, which allowed viewers on twitch.tv to play Hearthstone together on stream. Mouse input was collected from viewers using the brand new Twitch Extension system. The extension "Screen Controls" was developed by myself and used as stream overlay. Mouse input was send to my Amazon Web Server, which evaluated inputs (sorting out invalid inputs and calculating the user action with the most agreement each time step). The resulting action for each time step was send to my streaming PC, which automatically executed the action. Using Mixer Interactive we also initially had one click buttons for emotes, but moved over to twitch.tv due to insufficient amount of viewers. Unfortunately I didn't save the peak gameplay with over 50 concurrent players. Currently there only exists one gameplay video <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/177470538">here</a>. I might start the bot again, if either Twitch lowers stream delay, or if Mixer makes their FTL protocol more reliable for lower bandwidths.

            Accelerator VR is a real-time 3D game for the Oculus Rift. It relies solely on headtracking as its primary control scheme. The game has been developed using the Developer Kit 2 (DK2), however it is assumed to also work on the consumer version. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s5dHHcSMQRsjphck1GJxgg-5gU09Xorx">Download Link</a>.

            Instead of using one of the several GameMaker Engines provided
            by the community, I made my own little “engine”, building on the Quintus JavaScript HTML5 Game Engine and
            using Tiled Map Editor. It features 30 levels, including 2 original bosses and tons of deaths.
            Initially I used a basic account system and a MySQL-database, so I could store player progress server-side.
			Since Github doesn't provide that functionality it is currently not possible to save your progress (sorry). You can play the game directly in your browser <a href="./games/iwbtb">here</a>, or watch me
            play it in my <a href="https://youtu.be/ojSJBb3fBak">Personal Playthrough</a>. I do not claim any 
			copyright for the songs used in this game, so make sure to check out the
